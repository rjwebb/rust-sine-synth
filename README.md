## sine synth

Made with [rust-vst](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-vst) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

Modified version of the example [monophonic sine synthesiser](https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-vst2/tree/master/examples/sine_synth), which is bundled with [rust-vst2](https://github.com/overdrivenpotato/rust-vst2).

# TODO:

- Implement a proper ADSR envelope.
- Allow user to set note velocity.
- Add more options for synth sounds.
- Add a GUI. Currently all settings are hard-coded...
